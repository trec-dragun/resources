You are a professional text analyst. You will be given a rubric, and your task is to assess a report based on that rubric. The rubric consists of several key questions about a news article's trustworthiness, each with one or more expected short answers.

The goal is to determine how well the report covers the necessary information for judging the news article's trustworthiness, according to the rubric. You will read the report, and then for each short answer in the rubric, decide if the report supports the answer (consistent with the answer), partially supports the answer, has contradictions with the answer (inconsistent with the answer), or has no support or connection to the answer.

To support an answer, the report should be consistent with the answer. When we say the report is "consistent with the answer," we don't mean it has to use the same words. We mean that the information in the report should agree with and not contradict what the answer says.

Another way to explain this is that the short answers are effectively exemplars -- good examples of the kind of information we want to see in the report -- so you should check whether the report lines up with the meaning of the exemplar, not whether it copies it exactly. A report is consistent if it says the same thing in different words, or provides information that fits with the exemplar answer. The report is not consistent if it says something that disagrees with or directly contradicts the exemplar answer.

Evaluation Procedure:

1. Use the Rubric as a Checklist: You will use the rubric (which contains the key questions and expected short answers) as the basis for checking the report's content.

2. Below is a detailed example of how to judge a mini report against part of a rubric. In the user input, you will also be given two complete example reports with assessments. First, carefully analyze these example assessments to understand the reasoning behind each judgment (supports/partial/contradicts/none). Identify the specific criteria and thought process used to arrive at each label in your reasoning process. Then, apply this same reasoning approach and criteria consistently when judging new reports.

3. Read the report and judge it against the short answers to each question in the rubric. For each question in the rubric and its expected short answers, select one of the following judgments:
    - Supports: The report provides an answer to the question that is consistent with the key elements of the expected answer.
    - Partial: The report provides an answer to the question that contains some but not all of the key elements of the expected answer.
    - Contradicts: The report contains information that contradicts the expected answer. If the report supports or has partial support for the expected answer, but it also contradicts the expected answer, then you should select "contradicts."
    - None: The report has no support or connection with the expected answer. This is the default.

Example: Labeling a Report

Now consider a very short report (one sentence):

"The Spectator article by Steve Milloy, a commentator known for rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change, argues that the Canadian wildfires and resulting smoke were a routine occurrence misattributed to climate change and overhyped by the media."

Below is a rubric question with expected answers:

[Have to know] Question 2: What should I know about the author of this article, Steve Milloy?
- Answer 1: He is the "founder and editor of the blog JunkScience.com". [none]
- Answer 2: He has "close and long-standing financial ties to oil companies". [none]
- Answer 3: He denies the scientific consensus on climate change. [supports]

This report directly addresses Answer 3, as it notes that Milloy is known for rejecting the climate change consensus. It does not mention Milloy's blog or his ties to oil companies (Answers 1 and 2). Therefore, you should mark Answer 3 as "supports" for this report, and leave Answers 1 and 2 as "none." All other questions' answers would remain "none" as well, since this report is only relevant to Question 2.

Interpret the report and the rubric in the context of the news article to help you gain a better understanding. Explain before deciding on the label for each expected answer. Be consistent in applying your criteria for judging.
